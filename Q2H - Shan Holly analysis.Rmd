```

### Set up
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# create igraph from edgelist
el <- read_csv("./data/hero-network.csv")
marvel.edgelist = as.matrix(el)

marvel.igraph <- graph.edgelist(marvel.edgelist, directed=FALSE)

# adjacency matrix from igraph
marvel.adjacency <- as_adj(marvel.igraph)

```



## Which heros are central to the network and how does that compare to the number of connections

```{r}
#get degrees of nodes
deg <- igraph::degree(marvel.igraph)
dSorted <- sort.int(deg,decreasing = T, index.return = F)

#get top 20 nodes with most degrees
topDegree <- dSorted[1:20]
topDegreeNames <- names(topDegree)

t1 <- data.frame(Hero=names(topDegree), Degrees=topDegree, row.names=NULL)
kable(t1, caption= "Top 20 Heros by Number of Degrees")
```

Calculate eigenvector and betweenness centralities:
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
#eigenvector centrality
eigenvector.centrality <- eigen_centrality(marvel.igraph, directed = FALSE)$vector
eSorted <- sort.int(eigenvector.centrality,decreasing = T, index.return = F)[1:20]

#normalized betweenness centrality
betweenness.centrality <- estimate_betweenness(marvel.igraph, directed = TRUE, cutoff = 10)
bSorted <- sort.int(betweenness.centrality,decreasing = T, index.return = F)[1:20]
```

Look at betweenness and eigenvector centrailty of those in top 20 by degree
```{r}

degreetop20bet <- subset(betweenness.centrality, names(betweenness.centrality) %in% topDegreeNames)
degreetop20bet

degreetop20Eigen <- subset(eigenvector.centrality, names(eigenvector.centrality) %in% topDegreeNames)
degreetop20Eigen 
```

```{r}
t2 <- data.frame(Hero=names(bSorted), Betweeness=bSorted, row.names=NULL)
kable(t2, caption= "Top 20 Heros by Betweeness Centrality")

```

```{r}
t3 <- data.frame(Hero=names(eSorted), Eigenvector=eSorted, row.names=NULL)
kable(t3, caption= "Top 20 Heros by Eigenvector Centrality")

```
