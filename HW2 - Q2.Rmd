```{r}
el <- read_csv("~/classes/msan628/hero-network.csv")
el = as.matrix(el)

marvel <- graph.edgelist(el,directed=FALSE)
```
```{r, echo = TRUE}

#Count the total number of nodes
vcount(marvel)

#Count the total number of edges
ecount(marvel)
```
The network has 6,421 nodes and 574,467 edges. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Checking whether or not the network is connected
igraph::is.connected(marvel)
```
The network is not connected.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# decompose the graph into its connected components
comps <- decompose.graph(marvel) #calculates the connected components

#count the number of vertices in each connected component
table(sapply(comps, vcount)) 
```
The network has one giant cluster and 3 smaller ones.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
#Calculate the degree of the yeast network
d.marvel <- igraph::degree(marvel) #this is the degree sequence

#get the distribution of the degrees
summary(d.marvel)


#clip outliers
d.marvel.small <- d.marvel[d.marvel<200]

#plot 
hist(d.marvel.small,col="blue", breaks = 75,
     xlab="Degree", ylab="Frequency",
     main="Degree Distribution")
```

There are some very connected heros, with the node with the max degree having 16,499 connections. The distribution with outliers clipped shows the degrees peak around 10 degrees. 

```{r}
# get network diameter - max of shortest path distances excluding infinite paths

diameter(marvel)

```
